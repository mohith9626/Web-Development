            <p class="content">Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard
                 pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at 
                 one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this
                  (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out").

                (known as soccer in North America); gridiron football; Australian rules 
                football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are 
                known as "football codes".

            <p class="content">Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete 
                with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) 
                in diameter mounted 10 feet high to a backboard at each end of the court), while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.
                 A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.
